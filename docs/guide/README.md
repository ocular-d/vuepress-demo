## Features


## Docs As Code

*Docs As Code* assumes that you use the same tooling for writing documentation which you use for working on your code.

In the same manner that code editors are configured with plugins for reporting coding style violations,
you can configure your code editor with plugins that report inconsistencies with your company's editorial and content style guides.

Depending on your documentation, these could be plugins for checking the consistency of your markup language,
the style of headings, the length of documents and many more.

Consistent, tested documentation can help your product and your development cycle.

Consistency means that you write your documentation according to a defined standard reflecting your product and company.
It also means that you can find information quickly, and understand that information when you encounter problems.
