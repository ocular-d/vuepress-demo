### Requirements

## Test Component

<TestAlert display-text="Test" />

The minimum version of Python the Onna API supports is 3.6, but we reccommend installing [Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-380/ "Python 3.8").
It's recommended to also install `venv` and `pip` to handle requirements.

- [Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-380/ "Python 3.8")
- [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/ "Link to pip")
- [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html "Link to venv docs")
- [aiohttp](https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/ "Link to aiohttp library")
